       LEARN FROM COVID-19 Start

        <section class="container" id="covid-19">
            <h2 class="text-center covid-19-header">WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM COVID-19?</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 col-md-6">
                    <div class="covid-pera pt-5 pr-3">
                        <p>We have learned a lot from the horrible, sad and traumatic experiences that were forced upon
                            us
                            by this pandemic. It affected each of us on a very personal level. The effects were not
                            equally
                            divided among us. </p>
                        <p>Some lost much more than others. In spite of these painful circumstances, some people
                            actually
                            profited. But, please understand – Profiting from the misfortune of others is definitely NOT
                            what this is about! Quite the opposite.</p>
                        <p> <span class="covid-note">NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Huge numbers of businesses were forced to
                            shut their
                            doors. Promising
                            start-ups were
                            delayed or cancelled. Hopes and dreams were shattered for many.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, even in the midst and the aftermath of this widespread pain and suffering, there are
                            vast numbers of exciting business opportunities available. In fact, there are even more of
                            them now than there were before Covid-19 arrived. The key is knowing how to properly locate,
                            evaluate and acquire the best opportunities. </p>
                        <p>Our special business system was already deep into development long before Covid-19, but it is
                            now close to its worldwide launch. But because we have seen how many businesses were
                            affected by Covid-19, we restructured our launch parameters. We now have made some special
                            changes to our system and how we plan to launch.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 col-md-6">
                    <div class="covid-pera pt-5 pr-3">
                        <p> We believe that, because of Covid, when we finally initiate our worldwide launch
                            announcement, there will likely be much larger numbers of entrepreneurs interested in our
                            program than we initially estimated. So, if this is correct, we need to adjust.
                        </p>
                        <p> We are excited about that possibility, but we need a different launch plan. We want instead
                            to first identify a limited number of entrepreneurs to receive early access to our program
                            before our official launch. Instead, we want to train this chosen group.
                        </p>
                        <p> In other words, we want to work closely with a limited group of serious entrepreneurs before
                            the launch. We will give them early access to our entire system and then interact with them
                            to help them become “experts” well before the official launch.
                        </p>
                        <p> To locate and select these entrepreneurs, we have designed a plan. Once we have selected and
                            trained the required number of serious entrepreneurs needed, we will again move forward
                            toward our global launch.
                        </p>
                        <p> These entrepreneurs will also assist us, as part of their training, to evaluate and modify
                            several very advanced features of our system. So, realizing that we need their help with
                            these advanced features, we want to be sure that they will be focused.
                        </p>
